Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The user required a cloud based server for their program. This allowed users to be able to use their services from any device while also being scalable.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe that I have a deeper understanding of cloud based operating systems thanks to this project as it has inspired me to research into the topic further.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I like that the template distributed the work into smaller, more manageable sections that are easy to flow through.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would like to do more research on specific operating systems in order to make a more well-informed chart of their strengths and weaknesses.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I believe that all the user's needs were seen to as the program will be cloud based and will handle the servers so that the user can have a hands off and scalable product.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I would take my time to delve deeper into the concepts in order to make a stronger and more informed product.
